# spotify-muter-linux
spotify app mute timer for PulseAudio on Ubuntu linux

# Preparation
Set the path in `mute_spotify_timer` file to `mute_app`.

# Launch
Just launch `./mute_spotify_timer`

It is very simple approach (and resource efficient). I have binded it to a keyboard hotkey. When I hear ads, I just click on the button and enjoy some seconds of silence :)
